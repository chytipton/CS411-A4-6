User Stories

1) As a new user, I should be able to log in using an already existing account.  When a new user wants to try our app, 
they should be prompted to a login page where they can choose to login with Facebook or Google. Upon selecting either, 
they will be prompted to enter their Facebook or Google credentials. If they are entered correctly, they will be taken 
to the dashboard which features a side-bar with preference cities and a map centered on their current location (if 
location is given) or just a map of the world if not. If the fail to enter their credentials, they will be prompted to 
try again. 

2) As a logged-in user, I should be able to click and view different cities. Once logged in a user can either enter a 
city of interest into a search bar on the top left or view it on the map, which they are able to navigate using the mouse.
When the user begins typing a city of interest, the search bar will help auto-fill the city-name in a drop-down from the 
search bar. The user can then select this city and the map will travel to be centered on this city. If the city cannot be
found, the drop-down will say “City not found”. 

3)As a logged-in user, I should be able to favorite my frequent cities. As a user, after viewing a city as described in 
part 2, I should be able to then save it to my favorite locations for easy access in the future. I can do so by clicking 
a star next to the city name, and it will then be added to a favorites list on on the side-bar of my account as described 
in part 1.

4) As a logged-in user, I should be able to get updates on new news. If I have favorited cities as stated in part 3, 
I should be able to get new notifications when big events happen in the area. By default, I should receive a daily rundown 
but I can change my settings to be more often updates if I like. There will be an audible chime and a box will pop up in 
the top right corner containing information about the news stories.
